# Zebus

Zebus is a lightweight peer to peer service bus, built with CQRS principles in mind. It allows applications to communicate with each other in a fast and easy manner. Most of the complexity is hidden in the library and you can focus on writing code that matters to you, not debugging messaging code.

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Abc-Arbitrage/Zebus) for more information.
